# Chest with a timer
This chest has been created for a special school event.

# How to use it ?
When you load the page, you can see a button "Start" (Commencer !) to launch the timer. 
When you do that, the next button will turn to a "Unlock" (DÃ©verrouiller) button. Hitting this button will test the code you have put.

If the right number is in the right position, the input will turn green. Else, it will turn red. You can try as many times as you want as long as the timer is running. 

There is 2 different animations depending on if you succeded to unlock the chest, or not ! Try it yourself.
